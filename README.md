'Filter Bubbles' are becoming an increasingly common topic at Western dinner parties. In a world in which interconnection and free market capitalism have provided people with unlimited choice, the choices being made are increasingly narrow. People are choosing to live with people who look, think, and value the same things. Society is taking the path of least resistance, and leveraging new communication technologies to find like minds.

Interestingly, the dominance of these filter bubbles is much discussed, but comparatively poorly documented. As a person with a keen sense of civic duty, I thought I would help to fill in that gap.

This is my attempt to understand these bubbles, starting with the center left. Given the difficult logistics of any such endeavor, I decided to go with the NYT - perhaps the best possible proxy available for a project on a time crunch. The reasoning behind this was simple. The NYT is one of the most influential national journalistic institutions in the United States, by the measures of awards (), readership(), and revenue(public company).

It combines the Watson Natural Language Understanding software from IBM, in combination with calls to the NYT API to generate a sentiment analysis of articles that pertain to a user inputted topic. In the event that the user declines to enter a topic, the analysis defaults to information on Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump - two of the most discussed individuals globally in 2016. This is the compared against polling data in the post-primary U.S. general election

All information will be displayed on these graphs, as demonstrated below.








Reframe the project as a look into how accurate NYT reporting actually was ... were they overly ensconced in a bubble, or did they reasonably accurately read the tea leaves?




Hillary won a majority of pledged delegates on June 7th. Trump was declared the presumptive nominee on May 3rd, 2016.

I will therefore start data collection on June 10th, the Friday of that week. June 13th, the next Monday, was the date of the Pulse Night Club shooting.
